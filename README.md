# PyBer_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this analysis was to take data from a ride share service and analyze the average fare per ride and per driver in different city types as well as visualize the the total fares of each city type over the course of one year, here the year 2019.

## Results
When  the multi-line chart is examined:

it is clear that the urban city type has the highest total fare amount of the three by a large margin.

When the summary dataframe is examined one can draw a conclusion about the average fares based on the provided data.

The conclusion that can be drawn from the summary is that, despite urban areas having the highest total fares, the highest average per fare and per driver is in rural areas, followed by suburban areas. 

## Summary
One potential way to increase the amount of rides in rural and possibly suburban areas would be to offer discounts at certain times to riders. While this may lower both the average driver fare and average rider fare, it may increase the total rides and as long as the discount isn't too large to cause loses can increase the total fares in both areas.
